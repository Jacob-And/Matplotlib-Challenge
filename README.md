# Matplotlib-Challenge

The files included in this repo are as follows:
- Mouse_metadata.csv
- Study_results.csv
- pymaceuticals_starter.ibynb

Over the course of this challenge I merged the two aformentioned .csv files to create one conclusive dataframe, then created the summary statistics used in the future tables, mainly the mean volume. This was followed by creating a series of charts and graphs to visualize the datapoints and compare things like the amount of male mice versus the amount of female mice. I was crunched for time and wasn't sure exactly how to execute the for loop to find the outliers, so I ended up skipping that part to come back to at a later date. The last steps were determining whether or not the final scatter plots had any correlation/statistical significance, which it was determined that they do by utilizing the PearsonR function from scipy.stats
